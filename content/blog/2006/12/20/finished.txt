It's over â€“ I've finally graduated from college with my BS in CS, and I've got basically no obligations for the three weeks before I start working.

It's going to be nice relaxing for the Christmas break.  I plan on reading books, hanging out with friends (I've been notified that there might be a D&D game at some point) for the break, and generally having a typical Christmas season with family and friends in town.
