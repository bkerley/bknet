Got Monday's advanced discrete test back with a 90 today, which means that it's relatively easy for me to get a B in the class for the semester.  Also slammed through the last regular Human Geography test today (although the lack of an essay was disappointing), and **almost** presented the senior project (but ran out of between-class time).

UCSB CTF is Friday (I've had a dashbaord widget counting down the minutes and seconds for two weeks), and after that I just have exams and graduation.  Booyah.
