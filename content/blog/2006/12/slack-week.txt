The week between Christmas and New Year's is always pretty slack.  I'll probably drive across the state for a couple days in Tampa before the graduation party over in Satellite Beach, but until then I'll probably read some book, help a friend of mine move across town (out of his parents' house, and maybe work a bit on a Ruby HTTP library that lets me write less code than Net::HTTP makes me, but we'll see how that comes around soon enough.
