<div class="vcard">

<p>I'm <span class="fn">Bryce Kerley</span>, and I'm glad you've found my website.  I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from the <a href="http://www.usf.edu/">University of South Florida</a> (graduated December, 2006), and during my time there was active as the President of the <a href="http://www.csee.usf.edu/acm/">ACM chapter</a> and the <a href="http://wcsc.myweb.usf.edu/">Whitehatters Computer Security Club</a>.  I currently work in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami,_Florida" class="adr"><span class="locality">Miami</span>, <span class="region">FL</span></a>, and also participate in the <a href="http://0x28.net/">0x28 Thieves</a> computer security team.</p>

<p>You're probably at this page for one of these reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>You know me</li>
<li>You're looking for some goofy Ruby or Rails trick</li>
<li>You're interested in some of the security activities I've done</li>
<li>Some other computer, cooking, or more esoteric topic interests you</li>
</ul>

<p>If you've got specific questions, shoot me a mail at <a class="email" href="mailto:bkerley@brycekerley.net">bkerley@brycekerley.net</a>.  If it's more urgent, you can try my cell phone at <nobr class="tel">+1 (321) 794-1725</nobr>, but I'm not always in a position to catch it.</p>
