[Security at University](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/09/university_netw.html)

Thought this article was pretty good.  USF is kind of set up like this from what I've seen, with a big mostly unregulated periphery and then all the exciting stuff firewalled off in different datacenters.  Individual departments aren't so hot on security, but that's how it goes I guess.

I'm feeling it too - just set up and locked down a new webcam at work, not sure when it'll be up.
