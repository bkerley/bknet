I just happened to see this on [Jamis Buck's Blog](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2006/9/22/inspecting-a-live-ruby-process) today.  Looks pretty neat, apparently it's as simple as calling the rb_raise function from the debugger, which prints a stack trace:

    call (void)rb_raise((int)rb_eException, "raising an exception")

You can also apparently chew up the stack in a more complicated fashion.  It'll be neat to figure out what else you can do to a running ruby process.
