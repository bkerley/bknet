I'm blogging this from the airport, it's a little over an hour until I depart for vegas and defcon.

I'm still kind of torn on ACTF - while I'm still confident we'll do well, I'm kind of hoping that it's not going to be ridiculously hostile and full of people that just didn't feel like doing the kenshoto quals.  Also I'm kind of hoping that it'll be possible to script stuff, because that really seems to be the thing we do well in competitions.

I suppose we'll se soon enough.
