I just changed the front page of this site with a picture I whipped up with [NodeBox](http://nodebox.net/).  Fun program, although it hasn't changed my opinion on Python vs. Ruby.

My Communication for Engineers class finished up this week.  Not a bad class, although I already am starting to dread PowerPoint stuff with ugly templates and little content.  It's a good thing I picked an interesting topic (got a pretty swank grade for that tone).

On the security front, looks like MS still prefers obscurity, and would probably prefer if the security industry was run by businesses and not independent researchers; [they are disappointed with the Metasploit team](http://metasploit.blogspot.com/2006/06/microsoft-is-disappointed.html).
