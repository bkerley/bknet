Everybody in WCSC is totally on edge about the kenshoto qualifiers this weekend.  We've got some nice stuff cooking (I might bring a big pot of chili, as well as the mad sandwiches and 3 boxes of pop tarts I got today).

Bedtime, have to do some writing and presentation preparation for communications tomorrow.
