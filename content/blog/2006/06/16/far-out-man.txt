[Foodbloggin' appears in another newspaper](http://www.dailyherald.com/search/searchstory.asp?id=199609)

And I'm named:

>But foodbloggin also serves up photos of *Bryce’s “cheerios and chocolate soy milk,”* Shawn’s fuzzy “Colombian decaf coffee from Panera,” and Shirley’s “Belgian Milk Chocolate-coated California Raisins.”

(emphasis mine)

Other news - upgraded my k750i to a w800 today, the MP3 player works better but OH GOLLY is the orange skin tragically ugly.
