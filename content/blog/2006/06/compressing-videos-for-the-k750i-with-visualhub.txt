[VisualHub](http://www.visualhub.net/) just got released today, and I compressed a short Simpsons clip for it as a test.

To start with, leave VisualHub in iPod mode and fire up the Advanced dialog.  For this NTSC clip, I set the pixel size to 176x132, with a bitrate of 128 kb/s.  I set the audio to mono with the original sampling rate and a blank bitrate.

Save this as k750i NTSC because it's convenient :)

I dragged the video in, hit Start, and waited a few seconds (30 second video, going from WMV to MPEG-4).  Once that was done, I previewed it in QT player, and dropped it on my phone.

No picture of it on my phone because I can't move my hand fast enough.
