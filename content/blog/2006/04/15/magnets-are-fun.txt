Today, while working on the final project for my database class, I realized that I could use the hard drive magnets stuck to my fridge for more productive purposes than having a 6"x3"x2" cardboard-box magnet.

First, I taped a magnet to my Nerf Maverick:

After that, I taped a second magnet to my chair, originally experimenting with different separators between magnet and tape to reduce attraction.  This wasn't really necessary as it turns out - the unseparated magnet is just barely attractive enough.

Finally:

Instead of rooting down on my desk shelf grasping for the handle, I can just yank it right off and aim out my door in the blink of an eye.
