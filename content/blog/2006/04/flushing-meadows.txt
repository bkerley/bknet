Flushing Meadows is the final project my roommate and I are working on for our database class.  It's a database of restrooms and water fountains on campus, with ratings and comments.

The goal is to be cooler than all the other groups' projects.

Also a Maverick Magnet update: part of my chair is ferrous enough to stick to, so I don't need that magnet taped to the upholstery.  The plastic in the handle of the toy is too thick to have it stick to my chair with the magnet installed inside.
