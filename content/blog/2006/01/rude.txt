Operating Systems yesterday was kind of funny, in a sad way.  Half the class had their notebooks out for the class period, and not for the usual powerpoint-following.   My neighbor noticed that the prof was going over ways to protect critical sections, and he decides he needs to go on a library hunt right then instead of standing the chance of accidentally learning something.  The person a row ahead of me spent most of the class playing emulated games.

Note to self: don't compute in class unless you're taking notes.

Also with the help of CapnBry on the SA forums, I got textured sprites working in USFWeather, so it'll get pretty next time I work on it:
