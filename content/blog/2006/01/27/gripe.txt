As it turns out, making my OS assignment highly organized by splitting it into 12 files (6 .c, 6 .h) wasn't such a great idea, since the submit script only takes a single file.

Fixing this was a simple process:

    cat *.h *.c > bigfile.c

I then had to rearrange the order of the headers (command.h needed to come before child.h because a useful data structure is there) and a bunch of the #includes were redundant.

I'm giving a presentation to the ACM on Monday about subversion.  I figure that it's saved me a few times, might as well pass it on..
