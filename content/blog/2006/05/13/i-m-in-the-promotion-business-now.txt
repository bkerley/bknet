Lazy saturday, I'm back in Satellite Beach since my grandparents were in town.  Got me some new sandals, spent most of the week relaxin', pretty nice for the gap between spring classes and summer classes.

This post is kind of a clearinghouse for stuff I've been meaning to share.

[Zap's Modded Maverick](http://zap.bonzoesc.net/pics/mav/) has a laser sight.

How to HUP all runaway ruby processes (such as fcgi processes) to stop your Typo install from throwing an Application Error after a while:

    ps laxww | grep ruby | grep -v grep | awk '{print $3}' | xargs kill -HUP

Update: [got Engimo's typo runnin'](http://blog.whatthesite.com/articles/2006/05/13/bonzoesc-is-a-qt)
