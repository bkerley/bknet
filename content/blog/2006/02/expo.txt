Killer week - got most of the crazy cube wizard project for Operating Systems done (although if I ever see a wizard I'm going to karate them), found out the database project that we'll be working on for the last half of the semester is a blank check, and did a quick hack on the metlab site.

Engineerng Expo's tomorrow, and I don't really know how long I'm going to be there either day, but I'm pretty sure it'll be a long time.
