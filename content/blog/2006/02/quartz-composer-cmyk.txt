I was still in the shader-wranglin' mood this morning:

![CMYK.qtz preview](/typo/files/CMYK.png)

This one has a size paramter you can adjust, a size of 120 runs all right on my iBook, maybe you can kick it up higher if you have an ICBM or something.

[5kb QTZ](/typo/files/CMYK.qtz) for download.  Also [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html), but there's no license bundled in it because I'm lazy.
