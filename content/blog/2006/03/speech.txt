Yesterday I gave a speech at the ACM meeting.  It was officer election day.  Throughont the preceding 24 hours or so, I had <s>painstakingly</s> half-assedly prepared a speech for my campaign.

It's hard staying on topic when you're just so *excited* about an upcoming trip during spring break.  The [WCSC](http://wcsc.myweb.usf.edu) group is taking a trip to Georgia this weekend for a computer security competition, and I'm not even sure where to get started in preparing for it, because it's all IT security and not actually an attack/defense exercise.

It's going to be an interesting year as ACM president.
