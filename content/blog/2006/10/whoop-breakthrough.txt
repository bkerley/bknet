Made a big milestone today on the ol' senior project.  A week ago, I was [bellyachin'](/typo/articles/2006/09/24/rdf-is-a-pain) about reading XMP into key-value pairs.  Pretty much just today, I got enough code in to not just get the key-value pairs, but store them in a normalized sqlite database:

    bkerley@thedude ~/[...]/ape> ./ape tests/bigxmp.jpg
    Debug: XMP found at 0x000062d4
    Debug: loaded 27 key-value pairs
    bkerley@thedude ~/[...]/ape> sqlite3 ape.db "
    select properties.id, proptypes.propname, properties.content 
    from properties join proptypes on properties.proptype_id=proptypes.id"
    (boring parts eliminated)

What's next is porting the XMP reading part to C# for a visual XMP editor, which should be easy since I won't need so much custom code.

All this and I also got my postscript project for another class done on Thursday afternoon (said class was cancelled).
