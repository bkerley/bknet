I enabled this site for [hoodwink.d](http://hoodwinkd.hobix.com/) today.  The tricky part was getting the XPATH set up for the right spot in the page (you need quotes around the class literal).

If you want to get in on the metacommenting internet sub-layer thingy, you'll need:

* Firefox & Greasemonkey - I wish it worked with [Camino](http://www.caminobrowser.org/) but there's no simple javascript injection system for that
* To mangle your DNS to [nic.d](http://redhanded.hobix.com/cult/whoNicDOffWithTheYummyJunkDomains.html)
* If you can see content on [wasteland](http://wasteland.hobix.com/) it works.
