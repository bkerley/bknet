Learned this today when setting up an fsfs repository; if users are going to be using svn+ssh or some other method that reads and writes to the database as their uid, you need to make the permissions setgid:

    cd repodir
    chmod -R g+s .

What this does is makes any new files in the directory take the group of the directory, and not the primary group of the user that created them.
