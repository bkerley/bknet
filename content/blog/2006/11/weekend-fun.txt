Psyche!  This weekend's going to be busy.  We have a take-home test in Advanced Discrete that's due on Monday, and some senior project deadline's next week too.  Looks like I get to alternate between fun BCH stuff (NOT FUN) and making a recent version of [redland](http://librdf.org/) compile in Windows (NOT A GOOD OS TO USE).

[At least I'm not the only one in this boat](http://www.weaponofmassdisruption.com/?p=65)
