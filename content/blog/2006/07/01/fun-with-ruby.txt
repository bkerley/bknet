I was messing around with a project this week in Ruby, and right as I was trying to figure out how to best implement extensibility and modularity, [this article came along](http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb?ruby+plugins).

Main module require'd from main.rb:

    class Statement
      @@statementtypes = Array.new
      
      #implements plug-in nature of statements
      def self.inherited(stmttype)
        @@statementtypes << stmttype
      end
    end
    
    Dir["statements/*.rb"].each do |x|
      load x
    end

And each .rb file in statements/ has a class that inherits from Statement.

No details yet on what the project is, aside from that it's fun and challenging.
