Over the last few months you've probably seen me mention some nebulous project I've worked on with friends, without any actual details about the project beyond what I was writing about at the time.  It's time to come clean:

[USF CTF 2007](http://ctf07.usf.edu/)

My friends and I have been working on a security capture the flag game to be played in just over a month.  So far it's been a long project with lots of ups, downs, and long discssions.

For now there's still some stuff about the project that's staying on the DL, so more details in 34 days or so when it's all over.
