HTTPal and Carpark are now on Rubyforge.  What does this mean for you?

*** LOCAL GEMS ***

Carpark (18)
    car and cdr array functions

HTTPal (19)
    HTTP browser library
</pre>
You can still grab the source from my svn (the repos are at http://brycekerley.net/svn/carpark/ and http://brycekerley.net/svn/httpal/ ), and they now include Rakefiles to test and gem-ify them.  However, you'll need to make a [gem-signing key](http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/21) to do so without hacking the Rakefile.

Pretty much I'm just using Rubyforge for hosting the gems, at least until there's substantial documentation available for either package.

# Licensing

Carpark is public domain, and HTTPal is LGPL.  I reserve the right to change these in the future, and I still have to mark up the source.
