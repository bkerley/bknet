Lately I've been feeling kind of monolingual, having pretty much abandoned other languages in favor of Ruby in the past few months.  Part of it's that I haven't had anything really to work on in other languages, and I've also just been spinning my wheels trying to choose what to work on.

One thing that I've been working on every now and then has been a module player in Objective C and with the Cocoa GUI.  I haven't got much progress on it beyond playing files, but it's something I can work on when not preparing for a competition in short order.
