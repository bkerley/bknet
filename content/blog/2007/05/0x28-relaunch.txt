I worked all weekend on the redesign/relaunch of [0x28.net](http://0x28.net/), the site for our security group, 0x28 Thieves.  It used to be a boring site with a handful of pages, and nobody would have any reason to visit.  Now it's a tumbleog that I can post stupid stuff to (stuff that'd be too short and pointless to post here).

There's still a few things left to do on it, but I can hopefully move quickly on that evenings this week.
