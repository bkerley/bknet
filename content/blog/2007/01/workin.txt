I'm a workin' stiff now â€“ 40 hours/week, enough money to get me off a college student budget, and useful experience so far.  Also there's travel to northern (and therefore colder) places starting pretty much right away, so I get to see snow for the first time in a few years perhaps.

I've got some other stuff to show off, but there's other posts for that.
