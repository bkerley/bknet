*This is part of a possibly long-running series of posts about English mannerisms I see online that are overused or make me think less of the writer.*

"Flash forward to today, when I tried to run my windshield washers but horse blood came out!"

"Fast forward to last week when I accidentally dropped my cell phone in a meat grinder&#8230;"

There's better ways to say that, that don't invoke thoughts of streaky VCR tracking or gimmicks in short-running TV shows.  For indicating the passage of time, instead of using some phrase you thought was cool in grade school ("It has **FLASH** in it!"), try one of these alternate ways of saying the same thing:

"I ran my windshield wipers today and horse blood came out!"

"Last week, I dropped my cell phone into a running meat grinder."

Shorter sentences (usually better) that mean the same thing and won't feel outdated in five years or make you look like a semi-literate office drone.
