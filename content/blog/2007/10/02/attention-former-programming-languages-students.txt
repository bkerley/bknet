excerpt: Last fall I took Dr. Albrecht's awesome "Programming Languages" class at USF.  On a whim today, I took a look at one of the postscript programs I had written.

Some parts I can understand readily:

    (Grade Calculator by Bryce Kerley U-number) dup dup
    .85 .90 1 setrgbcolor %spiffy watermark
    -20 9.5 144 pt textdraw
    
    
    0 0 0 setrgbcolor
    2 10 12 pt textdraw %front and center

Some parts I remember fondly due to sheer smarmy cleverness (i.e. using the rgbcolor register as a loop index):

    currentrgbcolor %load current color
    dup 1 eq %if our blue was last filled up
    {pop pop pop 0.4 0 0.4} if %darken it down to purple
    
    3 1 roll %rotate it to the next primary or to brown/navy from purple
    setrgbcolor

And some parts that I forgot to comment I don't understand:

    pop dup grades exch get
    1 add exch
    grades 3 1 roll exch put
    true

So, if you're working in a "puzzle language" like Postscript you might want to include more useful comments than you normally do.
