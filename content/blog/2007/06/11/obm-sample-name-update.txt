So One Button Mod shows a real list of samples, exactly the way all the older players do.  It's nice to be able to read greetz :)

I'm still dissatisfied with the way the GUI looks.  I dragged some stuff around and changed it in Interface Builder, but I'm not satisfied with it.  I might go for some of the [grey hotness](http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/features/finder.html) that we're going to be seeing even more of in the next few months, but subclassing NSWindow's a long-term project.

And if I'm really lucky, Leopard will push the grey down to everything so it'll all be moot.
