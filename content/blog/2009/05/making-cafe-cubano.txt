I just got a new video camera, and had to make an appropriate first video.
Here's something to start your day with:

<object width="608" height="360"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/wV3BaUc1OGc&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x3a3a3a&color2=0x999999&hd=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/wV3BaUc1OGc&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x3a3a3a&color2=0x999999&hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="608" height="360"></embed></object

A few complaints I have:

* I need a tripod.  Cooking with one hand doesn't work.
* I need to write what I want to say first to keep vocal tics from leaking in.
* Editing HD video is really slow even on the current-gen MacBook.
