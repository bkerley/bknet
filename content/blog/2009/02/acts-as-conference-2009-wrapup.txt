excerpt:
  I try not to be a conference junkie; the last two years, the two have
  been DEF CON in Las Vegas, and acts\_as\_conference in Orlando.  The
  former's got quite the reputation for mildly-educational mayhem, but
  AAC has been growing pretty respectably.

Spent a lot of time talking with [Corey
Haines](http://coreyhaines.com/) about testing and the cost of fame
for Rails people (you'll probably freak out, make a really inciendary
blog post, and get a bad / horrible /
people-start-naming-their-projects-fu-yourname reputation), [Zach
Carter](http://zach.carter.name/) about all sorts of stuff, and others
that are escaping me right now.

It was pretty productive too: I hacked the twitter gem for Ted's [twitter2rss
app](http://github.com/trak3r/twitter2rss/tree/master), gave a
lightning talk about [using ragel to fix
radius](http://aac2009.confreaks.com/06-feb-2009-19-30-lightning-talk-regexes-vs-ragel-bryce-kerley.html)
(as seen in [Radius 0.6.0 - My Take](http://localhost:4331/blog/2009/02/radius-0-dot-6.html)),
and managed to get enough talking about other languages on the mind
that I ended up with an [Erlang in
Ruby](/blog/2009/02/pattern-matching-in-ruby.html) hack not
twenty-four hours later.

The speakers were great too, with [Bryan Liles](http://smartic.us) headlining
with important tools and techniques in testing all the f'n time and
b-boying, and [Dan Benjamin](http://hivelogic.com) continuing his
transformation into the Steve Jobs of Rails conference keynotes.

With this in mind, I think I'm going to have to put together a full-length
talk for next year's conference (somebody hold me to that), and I'll leave
it at that for now.
