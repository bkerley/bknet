Everyone agrees that Robocop 2 and 3 sucked. There was no romance, no intrigue, and
it was typical Frank Miller hack writing comic book fantasy cyborg and child-killin' BS.

**However**, the time *may* be right for another Robocop movie.  OCP was a pretty great
evil company and we all know there's no shortage of those right now (just go down
[the list](http://www.fedspending.org/fpds/tables.php?tabtype=t2&subtype=t&year=2008) haha),
so why not throw in a cyborg cop fightin' evil mercenaries or something?

SO here's the setup.  This PMC sets up shop in Detroit, pickin' up where OCP (Omni Consumer
Products) left off, all hiring well-paid ex-Army dudes to block off streets Baghdad-style
totin' assault rifles, but it's all wrong!  This is AMERICA, and in AMERICA we don't have
military fascism!

After Robocop gets rid of them (not sure how that'll work, from what I understand
mercenaries aren't like ED-209 and do not spectacularly fail on stairs) there's more!  A
congressional hearing will be called, and Robocop will not be able to hire a lawyer to
defend him (he's on the equipment budget instead of the personnel budget,) so he'll have to
do a bunch of detective work and solve a mystery in the second act.

Finally, after Robocop is absolved of all guilt, there's a third act with a sweet car chase
or something.  I haven't figured that part out yet.  Still though, I'd pay to watch it.
Robocop rules.
