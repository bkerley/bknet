[Bryce Kerley's GitHub](http://github.com/bkerley/): 90% of what I
program outside of work ends up on my github.  If it's an important
(to me) project there should be a blog post about it.

[Waiting For Gist](http://waitingf.org/ist/): Tumbleog of stuff I
find on [Gist](http://gist.github.com/) that amuses me or seems
momentarily useful.

[Poopstat.us](http://poopstat.us/): My first Erlang project, with
iPhone app "coming soon."

[Bryce Kerley's Twitter](http://twitter.com/bonzoesc): Irritating
jibber-jabber and occasional lucidity.
