I wanted a customizable tool to turn my daily [Twitter](http://twitter.com/BonzoESC) stream into a single daily Atom entry for self-explanatory reasons. 

[The result is on github](http://github.com/bkerley/tdigester/tree/master), and isn't terribly difficult to use:

1. Get the one file.
2. Make sure you have the prereqs (rubygems, twitter4r, activesupport, builder).
3. Edit the source to point at your twitter account, and the selection of updates that you want to get.
4. Run it and redirect the output somewhere fun/useful.
