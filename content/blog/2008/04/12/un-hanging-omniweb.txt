When using the [OmniWeb](http://www.omnigroup.com/omniweb/) browser, sometimes it'll get really unresonsive and crummy to use.  Here's one way to fix it:

1. Quit OmniWeb.
1. Go to ~/Library/Application Support/OmniWeb 5 in Finder.  In my case, this is /Users/bkerley/Library/Application Support/OmniWeb 5
2. Drag HistoryIndex.ox and the .log and .lock file (if they exist) into the trash.
3. Re-start OmniWeb.

My guess (an educated guess, thanks to Activity Monitor's Sample feature) is that this index of history items gets corrupted, and OmniWeb gets stuck in a tight loop trying to read or make sense of it.  The index re-generates from History.plist pretty quickly on modern systems, so deleting it is no real loss.
