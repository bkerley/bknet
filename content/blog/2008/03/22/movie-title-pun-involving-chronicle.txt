Added a couple features to Chronicle for your reading pleasure.

* An Atom feed is in place.  Use the link above, or hit [http://brycekerley.net/rss](http://brycekerley.net/rss) to see it.  It's going through feedburner for stats, so don't be surprised at the redirect.
* Page caching, thanks to the [Rails Caching Tutorial by Rails Envy](http://www.railsenvy.com/2007/2/28/rails-caching-tutorial).  Includes sweepers!

More features forthcoming, been busy with the new Smash Brothers.  (Verdict: controls weird, graphic design awful (the stage select screen has six words in four different fonts), still fun).
