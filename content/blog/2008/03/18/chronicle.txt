Things look different around here.

Mephisto was kind of hard to tweak and hack on, because of its heritage as both a weblog and CMS for people who might not necessarily know how to write webapps.  Hence the complicated theme system, liquid plugins, &c. that exist to make it usable for a wide audience.  However, this made it strange and unfamiliar to me.

This is "chronicle", hacked together from scratch in not much time.  I'm not open-sourcing it for now because it's seriously basically the barest-bones possible weblog system you can write in Rails, without any useful features like Atom feeds or publishing support.

It also doesn't support comments.  Suck on that, spambots.  If you want to comment, just email me (and get past the filter).
