Cars have too many things that can go wrong.  When I was leaving school yesterday (drove myself just to make sure my car still worked), it wouldn't start.  Got a jump, made it the better part of a mile, and it stalled at a crosswalk.  Managed to get the car pushed into a metered lot, and got a 72-hour "it don't work" sticker.

So I guess the plan is to buy a new battery, drive it to autozone and have them check to make sure the alternator works.  If it's busted then it'll be a fun part replacement time (read: not fun).
