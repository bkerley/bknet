<p>Tried the latest Web 2.0 buzzword-compliant browser "Flock" today.&nbsp; It's kind of tough and carbonized around the edges, like chili that wasn't stirred enough. Missed the library at school by 10 minutes, wanted to get a book, but they were all closed up.<br /></p><p>And then I was turning on the Xbox to watch a movie and somehow the knee of my shorts got ripped.&nbsp; Shoppin' tomorrow I guess :/<br /></p>
