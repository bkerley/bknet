Rainy day activity: learn another programming language.  Since Ruby and the Rails framework are internet popular right now, I figured I'd try it.  After some hours and a trip for a sandwich and a book, I finished it and decided to look around for other information about it.

I read the document about security, and lolled, because nowhere does the web tutorial mention that you need to use the h() helper method when echoing user-entered text.  I'm half tempted to go on a google search bonanza looking for half-finished rails applications, but I'm going to make some dinner instead.

Also when it does the category filtering, it does it in the view instead of the part of the controller that calls the query, so with a zillion rows, it'll have to send all those to Rails instead of letting the database server send over the ones it needs to.
