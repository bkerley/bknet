It's bright and sunny out.  There's basically no cloud cover (some extremely thin cirrus cover thousands of feet up is all I can see), the parking lot is as dry as ever, and it's finally below 80F in the afternoon (70F right now).

Us Tampa jerks really lucked out with Wilma.

But it's not so hot in Melbourne.  A stunning picture my brother took:
<img src="/textpattern/images/38.jpg" alt="Flooded and floating dock" style="height:480px;width:640px" />

That white thing is a dock.  It's nomally two feet above the water.  Now it's mostly a foot below, except for the parts that got separated from their pilings and are now floating.
