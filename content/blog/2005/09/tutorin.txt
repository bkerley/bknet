I've been working a few hours a day as a tutor at school.  While I'd like to say I've only worked with subjects from my department (computery stuff), most of what I've tutored has been Physics and Calculus.  This is funny to me because it basically echoes my own experiences with those two subjects.  If I'd had the guts to go seek extra help with those subjects, I'd be a very different person today.

On the plus side, I'm getting better at that stuff just by re-learning and teaching it again.  Two weeks ago I couldn't have done solids of revolution, but today I know both the shell and washer methods.
