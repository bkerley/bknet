I've been on a Beatles kick the past few days.  I really love everything they did post-Rubber Soul, and I think I can blame my parents for that.  One memory that stands out in particular from my childhood is learning the lyrics to Yellow Submarine from my dad who could play it on guitar.

Also, I finished my cryptosystem for Computer Security.  It's really lame and a known-plaintext attack will expose the key, but it ain't bad for a first try that only took a couple hours to implement.  <s>See</s> <strong>LIVE</strong> the atrocity "here":http://www.csee.usf.edu/~bkerley/friedrice/friedrice.pdf .
