I got tired of the Mercenaries soundtrack, so I fired up Odelay by Beck.  It's a true classic, diverse yet cohesive.

Slammed through my Geography final today, checked through my Automata take-home and I'm pretty pleased.  Software System Development (C# class) won't pose a problem, so the hard part of my semester's over.

Saw somebody on campus today I haven't seen since high school.  Amazingly coincidental, she was getting off the shuttle on the way to a job interview, while I was moseying to the exam.

DESSERT UPDATE: I just bit too far into my apple, and I still think it's the height of humor to declare the resulting situation a "core breach."
