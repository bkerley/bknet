<p>This shader makes the bottom portion of the frame (defined by the split variable, gently waving up and down by default) a wavy reflection of the top part composited with the unfiltered bottom part, with both frequency and opacity of the wavy reflection becoming less pronounced towards the bottom of the frame.</p>
<pre>sampler s0 : register(s0);
float4 p0 : register(c0);

#define width (p0[0])
#define height (p0[1])
#define counter (p0[2])
#define clock (p0[3])

float4 main(float2 tex : TEXCOORD0) : COLOR
{
	float split = 0.7+0.05*sin(clock/0.8); //border between real and reflection
	float diff = tex.y - split; //distance from split
	float shift = .005*sin(50*diff/tex.y)+.1*diff*sin(clock/0.8); //horizontal
	if (diff < 0) {
		return tex2D(s0, tex);
	}
	else {
		return 
		(1-3*sqrt(diff/8))*tex2D(s0, tex - 2*float2(shift, diff)) //shift
		 + 3*sqrt(diff/8)*tex2D(s0, tex) //see through
		;
	}
}
