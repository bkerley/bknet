I've done some preliminary diddling with some other blog software.  Look forward to changes in the next few days.

Also I hope you get lots of presents and eat lots of turkey.  My forecast is showing a high of 75&deg;F and thunderstorms, so maybe I'll have a Christmas with vile weather just like all those Northerners.
