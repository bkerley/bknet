I went to a leadership conference today, thanks to the two clubs I'm in needing leaders (and not just executives).  It was pretty fun, they got too much food so now I have tomorrow's breakfast done before sundown.

I'm really (<i>really</i>) excited about the CTF competition on Friday.  Zap's letting me borrow his old x86 laptop that actually has working card slots, so I'm going to load it up with some linux (probably Ubuntu because I'm not in the mood for ricer Gentoo).

Off to get some work done.
