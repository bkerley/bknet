Yesterday I finished my metasploit project for Computer Security.  It's basically a Perl implementation of <a href="http://milw0rm.org/id.php?id=1270">http://milw0rm.org/id.php?id=1270</a> that uses the msf payload instead of simply prompting for a command (in case you want to send a remote shell back to yourself or something).  It was pretty easy, so I might try it with a similar PHP-Nuke exploit.
