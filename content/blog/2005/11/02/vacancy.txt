It's nice being over the hump for the semester.  My birthday's coming up soon, one of my classes is finally getting to the interesting parts (no more basic object-oriented stuff!), and that sort of thing.  I can actually start thinking about Black Friday (have to see if flyers have shown up online yet), and registering for next semester's classes.

I've also started to get curious about what I should do after graduation.  While it would be nice moving on and getting a job, being a student is still lots of fun and I wouldn't mind doing research either.  I'm going to start looking for scholarships, although I'm still a year off from graduating.

Also I still need to get the alternator on my car checked.  It looks so sad and dejected at the back/bottom of the parking lot with the battery disconnected sitting on a mat of wind-swept sand and broken glass.
