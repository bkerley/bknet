I made some burritos for dinner tonight.

One green pepper
One onion
One stalk of celery
Package of lean ground beef

Brown the beef with the diced vegetables in a pan on the stove.

Add to taste (because I didn't measure)
Cumin
Paprika
Garlic
Chili Powder
Kosher Salt

After the onions are mostly limp but the green peppers haven't yet given up their stiffness (or maybe later, I've only done this once), shut off the stove and serve on a tortilla with cheese.
