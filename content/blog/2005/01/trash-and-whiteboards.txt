Whiteboards are awesome.  You can leave notes or strange pictures for other people that are looking if they're in your house.

I drew this on mine because I thought of how grouchy my roommate got when he had to take out the trash but didn't want to, and because Oscar was my dad's favorite Sesame Street character.

I think I'm going to change routers today - from a 133MHz IBM I got for $10 from a junk shop to a 333MHz Gateway said roommate brought up to the apartment because he didn't have anything to use it for.
