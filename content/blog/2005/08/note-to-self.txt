When trying to fill out spraypaints or the like in a game against an online map ( "in this case, Los Santos spraypaint tags in GTA: San Andreas":http://hem.bredband.net/708145/tags.html ), it's helpful to make a list of the ones you do before getting down to the last three and realizing you can't remember which ones you haven't done.
