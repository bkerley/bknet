The compressor for the a/c in my car is dying, and it'll cost more than 1/3 of the price of the car to fix.  I did some math (guessing), and I'm probably not going to bother with it, since I can buy sodas every day for a year (until I can get a different car with working a/c) cheaper than a new compressor.

On the plus side, I'll be getting 36 highway mpg.
