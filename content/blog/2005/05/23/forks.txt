I found this pile of forks on some dirty pavement while walking to 7-eleven for a coke yesterday.

I'm enjoying this summer so far - the weather hasn't been miserably hot when walking to class, and I've been somewhat good at getting a shady parking spot (even though there's construction around all the really good spots).
