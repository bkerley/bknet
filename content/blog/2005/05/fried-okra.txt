I made Fried Okra this weekend at a bbq at Zap's place.

<b>HOW I DID IT</b>
Get some raw okra, cut off the stem and skinny part at the bottom, and then slice it into pieces about 1cm long.
Put all these okra pieces in a gallon plastic bag.  Add corn meal and seasoning (I used Tony Chachere's Creole (best ever), but you could use normal seasoned salt if you're a wuss).
Shake.
Put in pan with some olive oil (but not too much olive oil - once your corn starch stops absorbing it, stop).
Fry for a while (the interior of the okra should be soft when you eat it).
