		<h1>Detective Ranking</h1>
		<ol>
			<li><i>Lennie Briscoe</i> - Briscoe stands alone as the greatest detective the world has ever known.  He's always there when wisecracks are called for, usually kind of grouchy, but still soft at heart.  Briscoe was played by the late and great Jerry Orbach.</li>
			<li><i>Ed Green</i> - Ed Green (performed by Jesse L. Martin) was Briscoe's last partner before leaving the 27<sup>th</sup> Precinct.  Affectionately known as, "Black Riker," to many fans, Green is an excellent foil for Briscoe's lightheartedness.</li>
			<li><i>John Munch</i> - Richard Belzer plays this Special Victims Unit detective, who resembles Briscoe in more ways than age.  They both play pool (although Briscoe usually wins), Munch's ex-wife dated Briscoe for a while, and both are really good detectives.</li>
			<li><i>Odafin Tutuola</i> - "Fin" is a SVU detective who is basically SVU's Det. Green.  He's Munch's partner, and is played by Ice-T, partially credited with the birth of gangster rap.</li>
			<li><i>Rey Curtis</i> - Rey Curtis was the second-best partner Briscoe ever had.  Although not as charismatic as Green, he was still great.  Rey Curtis was played by Benjamin Bratt.</li>
			<li><i>all those dudes I forgot</i> - most of the detectives on
				<font color="red">LAW &amp;</font>
				<font color="blue">ORDER</font>
				were pretty good.
			</li>
			<li><i>Joe Fontana</i> - <font size="+7">FONTANA IS NOT FUNNY, BUT IS BASICALLY A MEAN JERK AND A HORRIBLE DETECTIVE.  FONTANA IS PRETTY MUCH JUST A HORRIBLE REPLACEMENT FOR BRISCOE.</font>  Fontana is basically like a conservative radio host that tries to tell jokes and then gets all sad when they're revealed to be a giant failure.  As Fontana, Dennis Farina hopes to accomplish his goal of ruining the NYPD, as is his perogative from his former job as a detective for the fantastically corrupt Chicago PD.</li>
