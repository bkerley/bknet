		<h1>Jack McCoy</h1>
		<p>Jack McCoy is the embodiment of the ideal executive assistant district attorney.  He's pretty much awesome in court, and basically ignores ethics because, in his eyes, guilt transcends politics.  His views therefore suggest that he's a somewhat liberal centrist.</p>
		<p>You may recognize Jack McCoy's actor, Sam Waterston, from TD Waterhouse ads and the famous "Old Glory Robot Insurance," sketch on Saturday Night Live.</p>
		
		<h1>Arthur Branch</h1>
		<p>Branch is the Manhattan District Attorney in charge of McCoy and other ADAs.  He's from the South, and his drawl often leads his opponents into a false sense of security.  Branch is pretty conservative, and is played by former senator (R-TN) Fred Dalton Thompson.</p>
		
		<h1>Serena Southerlyn</h1>
		<p>Southerlyn is extremely liberal, and is the most-recognized ADA on Law &amp; Order.  She's played by Elizabeth RÃ¶hm.</p>
